                The Shortcomings of Automatic Accessibility Testing
            </h1>
            <h2>Differences in available tools</h2>
            <p>
                Due to the group being on different browsers during testing, some were on Firefox and some on Chrome,
                the built-in accessibility testing tools (Lighthouse and the "accessibility" tab in Firefox's Web
                developer tools) highlighted different areas of improvement,
                Firefox's tools was instantaneous and often highlighted missing aria-labels and similar errors, as it
                also offers a contrast mode simulating loss of colour, which passed as all clear, yet it would clearly
                not have any contrast at all, making it difficult to read, especially in low-light conditions.
                Luckily Lighthouse features a checklist to do manually as well, which covers several other angles which
                are not automatically tested.
            </p>
            <h2>The WCAG Standard</h2>
            <p>In Norway, we are bound by law to follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, according to <a
                    href="https://www.uutilsynet.no/wcag-standarden/wcag-standarden/86">uutilsynet</a>, there are 48
                guidelines in total, yet only 35 are required for the private sector. These guidelines allow for
                additional accommodation beyond just what the manual or automatic checks by Lighthouse or similar
                services recommend. For example, the manual checks from Lighthouse do not include any consideration to
                language or how well the title of pages describe the content, etc..</p>

            <h2>Our potential points of failure</h2>
            <p>As we made the decision to include dropdown dialogues, similar to how they were on the original page,
                this is our largest potential point of failure. Display: hidden for the dropdown content makes sure
                screen readers skip the
                reading the content if the dropdown menu is collapsed, so this potential pitfall is counteracted. Another example was the potential to navigate the website using the keyboard and avoid getting stuck somewhere, although our site was able to be navigated wihtout hiccups using the keyboard</p>

            <h2>Other examples from our code</h2>
            <p>Firefox's accessibility tool highlighted the need for increasing contrast for the links in the footer, as
                they did not have a contrast value larger than the minimum value for text, which is 4.5 or greater, this
                was resolved using this bit of code: <code>a:link, a:visited{
                color: black;
              }</code>. It also showed a violation of the required text labels on some icons, so that was fixed with
                <code>svg viewBox="0 0 17 16" aria-label="Icon showing an optional course"</code>. This example is from
                the course table. </p>
